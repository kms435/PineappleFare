# Pineapple Fare

This is a Google Chrome extension that displays the true airfare after hidden
fees (baggage, flight change fee, etc.) have been included.

To use this extension, click on the Pineapple Fare icon to select how many
bags you have and flight options you intend on using. The prices listed on
Kayak will change accordingly, with the updated price in red if the price
changed drastically, orange if it changed moderately, and green if the price
did not change at all.

Notes:
 * The prices update after the page has loaded fully, so it may take a while for some searches
 * This application is not fully developed - you may notice that many of our numbers are hard-coded and will not update with any changes in airline fees
 * Pineapple Fare was created during a 2-day hackathon by a team of 5 people (3 developers)

Thanks for trying out Pineapple Fare!
